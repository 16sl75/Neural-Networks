# Neural-Networks

CISC 452 Neural and Genetic Computing assignments completed at Queen's University in Fall 2019

## A1
- Implements a simple perceptron using error correction learning with pocket algorithm for the iris classification task
- Performance of the perceptron is cross compared with a simple ANN implemented using Tensorflow

## A2
- Implements a backpropagation algorithm in a multilayer perceptron for the MNIST task

## A3
- Implements a hybrid competitive learning network using LVQ (LVQ1) and LVQ and PCA (LVQ2) for the iris classification task
